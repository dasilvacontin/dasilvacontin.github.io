    <p>Hi! My name is David da Silva.</p>
    
    <p>I made this website to <strike>show-off my design skills</strike> display the case studies of some of my favourite projects / experiencies. It is by far not as complete as I'd like, but I don't have time to work on it right now.</p>
    
    <p>Some of my passions are:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>multiplayer games, its networking algorithms, and team strategy (e.g.&nbsp;in&nbsp;e-sports)</li>

        <li>interaction design, experience design, product design. <br>understanding human behavior.</li>

        <li>VR/AR/XR (whatever people use these days). Immersion!! You are inside!! It's part of your world!! You can interact with everything!! ðŸ¤¯</li>

        <li>making knowledge accessible â€“ written in a way that is easier to follow for a larger audience, and easier to understand through (if possible interactible) visualizations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have working experience as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Software Engineer Intern, Improbable (3mo)</li>
        <li>Front-end Developer, Toggl (1y)</li>
        <li>Multiplayer Online Games Course Teacher, VGAFIB (6 editions)</li>
        <li>Lead Designer, HackUPC (4 editions)</li>
        <li>Core Member, Mocha.js (>1y)</li>
        <li>Mobile Developer, Incubio (6mo)</li>
        <li>Freelance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Which doesn't say much about what I did at the place, I know. You can find out a bit more on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dasilvacontin/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, on my <a href="http://dasilvacont.in/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>, or just ask me directly! :)</p>

        <p>Every year around <a href="https://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/ResuscitationScience/UCM_477263_AHA-Cardiac-Arrest-Statistics.jsp%5bR=301,L,NC%5d" target="_blank">600,000 people</a> are going to have a cardiac arrest, heart disease alone is the leading cause of death in the US, claiming 600,000 lives per year. The chances of surviving are 4x if a first responder is in the scene, but only ~20% of the people know what to do.</p>
                
        <p>LifeSaber is an Android and Android-wear app that solves this problem, by making anyone a first responder and life saver, doing the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Guides anyone through correct CPR, with user friendly smartwatch interface
                <ul>
                    <li>Follows protocol to determine if CPR is needed</li>
                    <li>Gives haptic and audible feedback to keep pushes in synch</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Automatically calls 911</li>
            <li>Alerts nearby app users to provide assistance
                <ul>
                    <li>Sends nearby Automated External Defibrillator (AED) locations</li>
                    <li>Sends incident location</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We used <a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/myheartmap/#.WyqGbxL7S_A" target="_blank">UPenn's MyHeartMap AED database</a> and dumped it into MongoDB to get the nearest defibrilators to a person.</p>

        <p>Long story short, Logitech put at our disposal a Tobbi Eye Tracker. I started thinking about new interactions in games that could use them, or existing ones that could be improved through its use.</p>
        
        <p>I had recently been playing Tomb Raider on the Xbox ONE, and I remembered these two aspects of the game that left me wishing for a better experience:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I didn't need to observe the environment and think about what could be collected or interacted with, because those items would flash/shine in an obvious way, making me fall into a "detect shining things" mode. Or I would just end up walking next to everything just in case a context menu would pop up.</li>

            <li>when inspecting a relic to find an engraved description or detail on it (a kind of puzzle this game has), sometimes the game would consider that I had found it and unlock it for me, even if I visually hadn't noticed the detail, simply because after rotating the relic I had coincidentally stopped rotating it with the detail facing the camera. Boom! Challenge gone, for free. So fun.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>See, the problem here is capturing the player's intent. How do I discern between the player walking next to the bottle just because the bottle is on their way, or because the player wants to interact with the bottle? How do I confirm to the player that they can indeed interact with the item, without giving away that it's an interactable item when the player had no intention of interacting with it? This is specially hard in a 3rd person controller-based game â€“ first-person games can at least get away with using the center of the screen as a pointer.</p>
            
        <p>The relic puzzle has a similar problem: even if the engraved detail is visible on the screen, even on its center, it doesn't mean that the player has noticed it. A simple addition like making the player press a button when the detail is right in the center of the screen would have avoided this problem.</p>

        <p>Back to the hackathon, these two aspects were perfect test candidates for being improved with an Eye Tracker, which would be used as a pointing device to understand the player's intent: if the player is next to the bottle, and their eyes are pointing to the bottle, it is very likely that they want to interact with the bottle, so bring up that context menu. In the relic puzzle, if they fixate their eyes on the engraved text, that means that they have noticed it.</p>

        <p>Sounds great and exciting, right? Sadly, we couldn't get much working at the hackathon. It was a 24h one, we aimed too big instead of focusing and making incremental progress, we had hardware issues with our laptops and the Leap Motion (with which I wanted to be able to rotate the relic using my hand), I needed a lot of sleep time, and we didn't organize too well (integrating like 4 parallel Unity projects, hello darkness my old friend).</p>

        </h3>

        <p>My first solo Unity project, a homage to one of my favorite games. The controls are very hard, similar to drone racing (yaw, pitch &amp; roll).</p>

        <p>I worked on this in preparation for Improbable's interview â€“ I had barely touched Unity before, and an assigment required modifications to a Unity project. During the internship, I quickly added multiplayer support using Improbable's SpatialOS, to test how it was to integrate the SDK into an existing game.</p>

        <p>Fun bug I had: I made the jump force depend on `deltaTime`, so I sometimes had radically different jump heights (playing on a laptop contributed). Through this I learnt that one-off forces should <i>not</i> depend on time.</p>
