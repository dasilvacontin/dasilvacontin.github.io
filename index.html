        <p>Hello! 🎉 My name is <b>David da Silva</b>. I'm a Product Designer and UX Strategist with 5+ years of experience and a technical background. I’m a self-starter that fills the gaps, a teamplayer, and a mentor. I've been living in <b>London</b>🇬🇧 with my wife Liang since 2019. Some of my hobbies are downhill longboarding, boardgames, bouldering, and making interactive art.</p>

        <p><b>I'm currently looking for the next step in my career</b>. I'm looking for a team in which I can continue growing and where I can satisfy my itch for validating value propositions, conducting research, and executing evidence-based strategy.</p>

        <p>In the past, I've worked for organizations such as Google, Improbable, the3million, Toggl, and Sensa Design; I've ran side-hustles such as the 6-editions of my <i>Multiplayer Online Game Development</i> course; I've been invited to Apple's WWDC and to Facebook Global Hackathon Finals; I’ve organised 700-people events; I’ve received fan art of videogames I’ve made.</p>
